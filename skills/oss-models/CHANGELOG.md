# Changelog — oss-models skill

All notable changes to the `oss-models` skill are recorded here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). The skill's
frontmatter `version` is the source of truth for releases.

## [0.0.1] — 2026-10-01

Initial contribution — a Health & Life Sciences (HLS) guide for packaging,
registering, validating, and deploying open-source scientific/foundation models on
Databricks (acquire weights → MLflow PyFunc → Unity Catalog → Model Serving / Jobs).

### Added
- Guide-style `SKILL.md` with Overview, When to Use, Key Concepts, Decision
  Framework, Best Practices, Troubleshooting, Guardrails, and References.
- Model references for six families (single-cell transcriptomics; protein /
  biomolecular structure):
  - **Geneformer** — two deployment paths (serving exercised on workspace; end-to-end eval validation WIP): V1-10M
    (embedding dim 256) and NVIDIA BioNeMo / TransformerEngine V2-316M
    (embedding dim 1152). The TransformerEngine checkpoints load via pip (no
    Docker container required), keeping the standard PyFunc → Unity Catalog →
    Model Serving flow.
  - **TEDDY** (`Merck/TEDDY`, arXiv:2503.03485) — single-cell scRNA-seq
    embeddings; code and weights Apache-2.0.
  - **scGPT** and **SCimilarity** — expanded references, flagged
    work-in-progress pending further workspace testing.
  - **AlphaFold/OpenFold** and **Boltz** — protein / biomolecular structure
    prediction (Jobs or hybrid deployment bias).
- Shared references: integration contract, model template, evaluation,
  maintenance, and a per-family index.
- Best Practices and Troubleshooting expanded from hands-on workspace-deployment
  lessons (dependency pinning, Serverless `/tmp`, file-based model logging,
  signature-based test payloads, inference-table name conflicts, TransformerEngine
  serving, and more).
- Evaluation harness (`tests/`) — a with-skills vs. no-skills Genie Code
  performance assessment. TEDDY and TEDDY + Vector Search comparisons complete;
  Geneformer ground truth validated with and without the NVIDIA engine; the
  skills-vs-no-skills comparison for Geneformer is still to follow.

### Attribution
- Incorporates @yenlow's TEDDY contribution (originally submitted as PR #7).

### Notes
- `version` is intentionally `0.0.1` — an initial, early-development release;
  scGPT and SCimilarity remain work-in-progress.
